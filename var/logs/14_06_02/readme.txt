June 2, 2014 - Catastrophic crash by Murphy due to changing the pitch in-flight while tuning the AUTO throttle tuning block. Summary below:

Tuning of the aircraft Murphy was underway. Weather conditions were well within acceptable levels. AUTO 1 was tuned out completely, and AUTO 2 tuning was being performed. The block AUTO Throttle tuning was being used to tune this portion of flight. This block tells the aircraft to fly in a straight line, whilst maintaining a set ground speed and altitude.  When this block was engaged the throttle would widely change from minimum cruise throttle to maximum cruise throttle settings to maintain altitude. This block was engaged multiple times. Some flight variable can be changed while in flight. The variable pitch of vz was lowered. This variable tells the autopilot how much elevator it should use to maintain altitude. When the block was engaged the plane started picking up speed as throttle was being used to attempt to maintain altitude. The plane oversped. The pilot put the plane back into manual, but was unable to regain control. The plane crash landed into the ground.

The crash occurs in Autopilot Logs/14_06_02__16_51_26.log, starting at 1315s.
