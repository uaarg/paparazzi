June 15, 2014 - Murphy's 1st crash into the North Saskatchewan river due to flaperons not being disengaged on takeoff. Summary below:

Tuning of a brand new airframe was underway. Weather conditions were well within acceptable levels. AUTO 1 had been tuned out successfully that day. The airframe being used was the new plane Inconceivable. Inconceivable carried an extra battery, so it was deemed absolutely necessary to implement flaperons for take off into the airframe file. After multiple flights that day and successful use of flaperons another flight was performed. Flaperons were engaged on takeoff, but were not disengaged once the plane was in the air. Flaperons severely restricts proper roll movement. Shortly into the flight the plane started rolling and the pilot was unable to correct for the error. The plane crash landed into the North Saskatchewan river.
